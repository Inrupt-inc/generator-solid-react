# Generator development

## Making a change to the generated code
First, generate an empty generator app and make and test your changes there.
Then copy the changes you made in the src/ folder of your app to generators/app/src/ folder of the generator.

## Adding a menu item
See https://github.com/inrupt/generator-solid-react/pull/249 for an example.

## Testing the generator locally
To try out the generator with your change follow the [`yo` from a local generator](https://github.com/yeoman/yo#usage)
instructions.
