# Solid React Application Generator
Based on Facebook's <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank">Create React App</a>.

Application Generator for [Solid](https://solid.inrupt.com) React applications. Part of the [React SDK for Solid](https://github.com/inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk).

## External Dependencies

* [Solid React Components](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-components)
* [Solid Atomic Style Guide](https://design.inrupt.com)
* [LDFlex](https://github.com/solid/query-ldflex)
* [React Toast Notifications](https://jossmac.github.io/react-toast-notifications/)
* [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io)

## Prerequisites

To install the Generator, you will need both npm and Yeoman if you don't already have them.

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that you’re sharing. To install, follow the instructions at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Yeoman provides a generator ecosystem to scaffold complete projects. You can install Yeoman using the following command:

```
npm install -g yo
```

## Installation and Usage

To install the generator:

```
npm install -g @inrupt/generator-solid-react
``` 

Once it is installed, you can create a new application with just a few steps.

1. In a console window, navigate to the desired parent folder of the new application
2. Use the command ``` yo @inrupt/solid-react ```
3. You will be prompted to make an application name. This will be the new folder the app lives inside
4. Navigate into the new folder
5. If you would like to start the application, simply run ``` npm run start ``` in the new folder, otherwise you can begin editing and writing your application!

## What is a Generator?

A [Yeoman generator](https://yeoman.io/) is a scaffolding tool at its core. You can use Yeoman to install applications based on templates. This repo is an example of a template - an application with a build, code structure, and dependencies added and organized for you!

Using a generator accelerates application development. You don't have to worry about best practices for foundational elements, because we've incorporated them. Our template generates a fully functional application foundation that becomes the base of your new project.

We have included integrations with essential libraries, as well as pages, routes, and components that are both useful in most Solid applications (like login pages) but also serve as example code to demonstrate how to interface with Solid and [Linked Data](https://solid.inrupt.com/docs/intro-to-linked-data).

The generated application also incorporates our [Atomic Style Guide](https://design.inrupt.com/atomic-core), featuring a nice integration with [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com).

## Creating a Solid React Application

Once you've [run the generator](#installation-and-usage) and created your starter application, you'll have a site with some basic functionality and style guide integration.

If you would like to add your own look and feel, there are two options. First, you can override the styles from the style guide on demand. A list of the classes and example code can be found on the github page. Second, you could remove the style guide entirely, by removing the dependency from npm / package.json. Note if you do this, the application will lose almost all of its styling, and will need work to look "right" again.

Next, you can start building your application! Feel free to remove any pages or code you no longer need. You can use pages (such as the Welcome Page) provided by the generator as a template for how to build your next pages.

There are also examples of how to use libraries like [LDFlex](https://github.com/solid/query-ldflex) for reading and writing data to a POD, and examples of using existing components.

## What's in the starter application?

The SDK is continually evolving. Take a look at the [Release Timeline](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/tree/master#release-timeline) for what’s currently currently planned. This release includes:

* [User Registration](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#user-registration) for a Solid Pod.
* [User Authentication](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#user-authentication) against user selected Providers.
* Use of an [Atomic Style Guide](https://design.inrupt.com/) that you can use to style your applications.
* Infrastructure and applied best practices for [Error Handling](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk#error-handling), [Testing](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk#test-infrastructure), and [Accessibility](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk#accessibility).
 
Currently in the plan for release over the next components to handle [User Profiles](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#user-profile) and [Preferences](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#user-preferences), [i18n](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#internationalization), [Notifications](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#notifications), [Access Control](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#access-control), [Linking Things](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#linking-things), and [Data Discovery](https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/solid-react-sdk/blob/master/README.md#data-discovery).

## Error Handling

We provide different types of error handling in the generated application, which ultimately fall into the following two groups:

1. ***Service Errors***: These errors usually come from an external resource, like a server, library, or other dependency. In our case, this also includes errors from the Solid Server. We use try/catch blocks to display a message to the user.

2. ***UI Errors***: Data errors when a component waits for formatted data typically lead to these. If the data format is wrong, or there are missing properties that are required, this kind of error could trigger. We're using [React Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to show custom messages to the user, rather than the default, which is to show the component tree.


 ### Service Errors

 We provide a custom wrapper component around the React Toast Notifications library to handle Service Errors.

***Usage***

First, you will need to import ToastConsumer to have Toaster methods available:

```javascript
import { ToastConsumer } from 'react-toast-notifications';
```
Second, call the add method to show a toaster notification

```javascript
<ToastConsumer>

   {({ add }) => (
      <button onClick={(e) => add(['Title', 'Message'], { appearance: 'error | success | warning' })}>
        Toasty
      </button>
    )}

</ToastConsumer>
 ```

 You can also use [Higher-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) to have props available in your component:

 ```javascript
  withToastManager(YourComponent);
 ```

 The idea is to catch all of the errors from external services and show the user as much detail as we can about the source of the error.

### UI Errors

We are using [React Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html), and we have a top level component called ```ErrorBoundaries``` located in the ```components``` folder to catch all possible errors in our components.

Also included in the same folder is a custom markup component for these global errors, appropriately called ```GlobalErrors```. It contains the actual HTML markup and default text for this component.

In the event you want more specific errors in a given component, you can call ErrorBoundaries and create your own custom markup:

```javascript
<ErrorBoundary
  component={(error, info) => <GlobalError error={error} info={info} />} >
  <App />
</ErrorBoundary>
  ```

## Deployment

Once your application is ready, you can deploy it to a server of your choice.

It is ***highly recommended*** that you ensure your server is utilizing TLS. If not, you may encounter security-related errors in the browser, particular in Google Chrome.
